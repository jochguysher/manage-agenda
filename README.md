A tool for adding entries to your Google Calendar from email messages and web pages using Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract event information.

![Architecture diagram showing the system flow for LLM-driven event extraction and multi-account calendar management](docs/architecture.jpg)

## Features

- **Automatically extract event information from:**
  - **Gmail** messages
  - **IMAP** email accounts
  - **Web pages** and URLs, including structured data (JSON-LD, script tags). Supports batch-processing URLs from `~/notes` via [note-taker](https://github.com/fernand0/another-note-taking-app) integration
  - **Text files** stored locally
  - Extraction features available for all sources:
    - **Multi-event extraction**: Extract multiple events from a single source
    - **Smart date recognition**: Advanced date parsing for complex scheduling scenarios
    - **Cache bypass**: Force refresh web content to bypass cache with `--force-refresh` flag
- **LLM-powered event extraction:**
  - Supports **Ollama** (local models), **Gemini**, and **Mistral**
  - **Model evaluation**: Compare multiple Ollama models side-by-side with the `llm evaluate` command
  - **Interactive fallback**: When extraction fails, retry, provide a text snippet, or skip
  - **Retry option**: Retry LLM processing during date confirmation with 'r' option
  - **Memory error handling**: Automatic fallback when models require more memory
  - **AI model metadata**: Calendar events include metadata about which model processed them
- **Calendar management:**
  - **Sync**: Seamlessly add events to your Google Calendar
  - **Flexible output**: Add events directly to Google Calendar or save as JSON files
  - **Multiple accounts**: Support for multiple email and calendar accounts
  - **Event operations**: Clean, copy, move, delete, and update calendar events
  - **Enhanced event selection**: Select events by number or by entering text to match event titles
- **Auth Helper**: The `auth` command guides you through Google API credential setup

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- API keys for LLM providers (optional, for cloud models)

### Quick Setup
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fernand0/manage-agenda.git
cd manage-agenda
uv sync  # or pip install -e .
```

### Install Browser (for web page processing)
```bash
# Install the default browser engine (Firefox) for Playwright
uv run manage-agenda install

# Or install a different browser
uv run manage-agenda install -b chromium
```

### Desktop window (optional)
The same features are available in a desktop window built with [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) (LGPL). It is an optional extra, so the command line keeps working without it:

```bash
uv sync --extra gui        # or: pip install 'manage-agenda[gui]'
uv run manage-agenda gui   # or the manage-agenda-gui script
```

See [Desktop window](#desktop-window) below for what it does and how it differs from the terminal.

### Configuration
1. Install [socialModules](https://github.com/fernand0/socialModules) for email/calendar integration
2. Configure your email and calendar accounts using socialModules
3. Set up API keys for LLM providers (if using cloud models)
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))
5. Optionally install [note-taker](https://github.com/fernand0/another-note-taking-app) for batch URL processing from notes

## Usage

### Basic Usage
The easiest way to run the tool is using `uv`:

```bash
# Show help
uv run manage-agenda --help

# Add events (interactive mode - choose email or web source)
uv run manage-agenda add -i

# Add events from email (non-interactive, uses default LLM)
uv run manage-agenda add

# Add events with a specific LLM
uv run manage-agenda add -a gemini
uv run manage-agenda add -a mistral

# Add events from a specific source
uv run manage-agenda add -s web
uv run manage-agenda add -s imap
uv run manage-agenda add -s text

# Add events with force refresh (bypass cache)
uv run manage-agenda add -i -f

# Save events to JSON files instead of adding to calendar
uv run manage-agenda add -o file

# Add events to a specific calendar
uv run manage-agenda add -d "My Calendar"

# Copy events between calendars
uv run manage-agenda copy

# Clean calendar entries (select between copy or delete)
uv run manage-agenda clean

# Update event status from busy to available
uv run manage-agenda update-status

# Evaluate Ollama models
uv run manage-agenda llm evaluate

# Check/setup Google API authentication
uv run manage-agenda auth -i

# Install Playwright browser
uv run manage-agenda install
```

### Interactive Event Processing
When running in interactive mode (`-i`):

1. Select an AI model (Local/mistral/gemini) (l/m/g)
2. Choose a specific model from the available options
3. Select a source: email account, web, or text files
4. For web sources:
   - Enter URLs directly, or
   - Press Enter to automatically extract URLs from `~/notes` (requires note-taker)
5. The tool extracts content and sends it to the selected AI for event parsing
6. If multiple events are found, each is processed individually
7. Select a Google Calendar account
8. Review and confirm event details
9. When confirming dates, you can choose:
   - `s`: Dates are correct (yes)
   - `n`: Manually enter new dates
   - `r`: Retry - ask the LLM again with the same prompt
   - `Y`: Modify year, `M`: month, `D`: day, `h`: hour, `m`: minute
10. Optionally remove the tag from processed emails / delete processed notes

### Interactive Fallback
When LLM extraction fails, in interactive mode you get options:
- `r`: Retry with the same content
- `p`: Provide a relevant text snippet for the LLM to focus on
- `s`: Skip the item

## Commands

### `add` - Add Events
Add entries to your calendar from email, web, or text file sources. In interactive mode, presents a unified source selection menu (email accounts, web, and text files).

**Persistent configuration**: the LLM provider, model, and destination calendar(s) are asked interactively only once. That first interactive choice is saved to `~/.config/manage-agenda/config.yaml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/manage-agenda/config.yaml`) and reused automatically on every later run, whether or not `-i` is passed. Use `--reconfigure` to reopen the setup and save a new choice. A `-a`/`-m`/`-d` flag always overrides the saved value for that one run only, without changing what is saved.

**Multiple calendars**: the calendar step of the interactive setup is a checkbox - pick one, the other, or both. Every event `add` creates is then written to each selected calendar. `config.yaml`'s `calendar` key holds a list accordingly (a config saved by an older version, with a single calendar id as a plain string, still loads correctly and is rewritten as a list the next time the wizard runs). If a calendar fails while the others succeed, the message stays pending and the whole run is retried next time; the calendars that already got the event are recognized as duplicates, so nothing is created twice.

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode
- `-a, --ai`: Select LLM provider for this run only, without changing the saved configuration. Options: `ollama`, `gemini`, `mistral`
- `-m, --model`: Select model for this run only, without changing the saved configuration
- `-s, --source`: Select data source (default: `gmail`). Options: `gmail`, `imap`, `web`, `text`
- `-f, --force-refresh`: Force refresh web content to bypass cache
- `-d, --destination`: A single calendar id to use for this run only, replacing the whole saved list, without changing the saved configuration
- `-o, --output`: Output destination (default: `calendar`). Options: `calendar`, `file`, `files`
- `--reconfigure`: Reopen the interactive setup for provider, model, and calendar(s), and save the result

### `llm` - LLM Operations
Group command for LLM-related operations.

#### `llm evaluate`
Evaluate multiple Ollama models by running the same prompt through each and comparing responses and timing. Optionally accepts a prompt argument; if not provided, allows selecting an email to use as prompt.

##### Options
- `-t, --type`: Evaluation input type (default: `txt`). Options: `email`, `web`, `txt`
- `-o, --output`: Output destination (default: `file`). Options: `calendar`, `file`, `files`
- `PROMPT` (optional argument): Text prompt to evaluate directly

### `auth` - Authentication Setup
Check Google API authentication status and display setup instructions if credentials are missing. Shows step-by-step guidance for enabling the Gmail/Calendar API and creating OAuth credentials.

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode

### `install` - Install Browser
Install the Playwright browser engine needed for web page processing.

#### Options
- `-b, --browser`: Which browser to install (default: `firefox`). Options: `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`, `chrome`, `chrome-beta`

### `clean` - Clean Calendar Entries
Combined command that allows users to select between copy or delete operations in a single workflow. This command provides an interactive menu to choose between copying events to another calendar or deleting them, with filtering capabilities.

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode
- `-s, --source`: Select source calendar
- `-d, --destination`: Select destination calendar
- `-t, --text`: Filter events by title text

### `copy` - Copy Events
Copy events from one calendar to another with filtering capabilities.

#### Options

- `-s, --source`: Select source calendar
- `-d, --destination`: Select destination calendar
- `-t, --text`: Filter events by title text

### `delete` - Delete Events
Delete events from a calendar with text-based filtering.

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode
- `-s, --source`: Select source calendar
- `-t, --text`: Filter events by title text

### `move` - Move Events
Move events between calendars (equivalent to copy + delete).

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode
- `-s, --source`: Select source calendar
- `-d, --destination`: Select destination calendar
- `-t, --text`: Filter events by title text

### `update-status` - Update Event Status
Change event status from busy to available (free) for selected events. This command allows users to update the transparency of calendar events from "opaque" (busy) to "transparent" (available), making them appear as free time on your calendar.

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode
- `-s, --source`: Select source calendar
- `-t, --text`: Filter events by title text

> **Event Selection** (applies to `clean`, `copy`, `delete`, `move`, `update-status`):
> - Enter comma-separated numbers to select specific events (e.g., `0,2,4`)
> - Enter `all` to select all events
> - Enter text to match events containing that text (e.g., `meeting` selects all events with "meeting" in the title)

### `gcalendar` - List Calendar Events
Display events from your Google Calendar.

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode

### `gmail` - List Emails
Display emails from your Gmail account.

#### Options
- `-i, --interactive`: Running in interactive mode

### `gui` - Desktop Window
Open the desktop window (needs the `gui` extra, see [Desktop window](#desktop-window)). `-v` before the command shows debug records in the window's log panel.

## Desktop window

`manage-agenda gui` opens a window with one screen per family of commands, a log panel and a status bar. Every screen runs the **same code the corresponding command runs**: the window only replaces the terminal's questions with dialogs. Nothing is duplicated, so the ledger, the mailbox marking and the saved configuration behave exactly as on the command line.

| Command | Screen |
|---|---|
| `add` | Add events: source, model, destination calendars, options; the run's questions (an old message, a failed extraction, the event review, the label removal) are dialogs |
| `copy`, `move`, `delete`, `clean`, `update-status` | Calendar operations: give the calendar ids and the title filter, or answer the dialogs as with `-i` |
| `reconcile`, `migrate-ledger`, `restore` | Ledger: dry run, account choice, the exit code in the status bar; a table of the restorable identities |
| `llm evaluate` | Evaluate models |
| `auth` | Authentication: the check, and the browser consent |
| `gmail`, `gcalendar` | Lists: the folder or calendar as a table |
| `install` | Install browser, output streamed to the log |
| the `config.yaml` wizard | Settings: provider, model, calendar account and calendars, language |

Notes:

- One job runs at a time. **Cancel** stops it at its next question, or right away if it is waiting on one; a call in progress (a model request, a mailbox fetch, the browser consent) finishes on its own. A run cancelled during the event review leaves no ledger entry and marks nothing in the mailbox; one cancelled at the "remove the label?" question still records the event that was already created.
- The event review dialog shows and edits times in local time and writes them back in UTC, as the terminal's date corrections end up after normalisation.
- The language follows the same `language` key of `config.yaml` (or the system locale) and applies at the next start.
- The ledger and `config.yaml` are not locked: do not run the window's `add` and a scheduled (cron) `add` at the same time on the same account.
- The `gui` extra depends on PySide6, released under the LGPL; the rest of the tool does not import it.

## Supported LLM Providers

The tool supports multiple LLM providers:

- **Ollama** (default): Local models with automatic memory error handling
- **Google Gemini**: Via Gemini API Python SDK
- **Mistral**: Via Mistral Python Client

Each provider requires specific configuration and API keys (for cloud services).

## Environment Variables

Configuration can be set via environment variables or a `.env` file. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a template.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | API key for Google Gemini | — |
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | API key for Mistral AI | — |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Ollama server URL | `http://localhost:11434` |
| `OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Default Ollama model | `llama3.1` |
| `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` | IANA timezone for events | `Europe/Berlin` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `INFO` |
| `LOG_FILE` | Path to log file | `manage_agenda.log` |
| `DEFAULT_EMAIL_TAG` | Gmail label/tag for event emails | `zAgenda` |

## Interface Language

The CLI's own text (prompts, messages, and `--help` output) is available in English and French. The language is detected automatically from the host's locale (`LC_ALL`, then `LANG`, then `LANGUAGE`) and falls back to English if neither is set or recognized. To force a language regardless of the system locale, set it in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
language: fr
```

`--help` itself is translated (e.g. `LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 manage-agenda add --help` prints French option descriptions); Click's own built-in `--help`/`--version` flag text stays English, since that's framework-level rather than part of this tool's interface.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-event extraction** from a single source, with individual processing per event
- **Structured data extraction** from JSON-LD and script tags in web pages, with full-text fallback
- **Smart date parsing** handling complex formats, multiple languages, relative dates, and time information
- **Memory error handling** with automatic fallback to lighter Ollama models
- **External prompt management** for customization without code changes
- **AI model metadata** tracked in calendar events (model name, processing time)
